# Welcome to FileSilo

If you are looking for a simple solution to share files with others and you have a Domino server exposed to the internet, then FileSilo is your friend.

FileSilo allows you to create collections of files (or single files) that can be simply shared with others using a unique key. You can send a special link to your customer so that the collection of files can be accessed directly without logging in or the need of registering to some system.

On the other hand, you can allow anonymous users to upload files to this application. You get a notification of this happens and the upload automatically will expire and will be deleted after a certain amount of time.

With FileSilo you can solve a simple need without using heavy systems like cloud services such as OneDrive, SharePoint or NextCloud.
